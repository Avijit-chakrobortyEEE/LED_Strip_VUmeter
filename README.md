# LED_Strip_VUmeter

## LED Strip VU Meter using LM393 Sound Sensor & Arduino

# 📌 Project Description

This project is an LED Strip VU Meter that visualizes audio levels using an LM393 sound sensor and an Arduino. The LED strip dynamically responds to the surrounding sound intensity, creating an audio-reactive light effect.

# 🎨 Features

✅ Sound-activated LED visualization✅ Adjustable sensitivity✅ Works with any audio source✅ Simple and cost-effective circuit

# 🛠 Components Required

Arduino (Uno, Nano, or compatible)

LM393 Sound Sensor

LED Strip (WS2812B, Neopixel, or simple RGB LED strip)

Wires

Power Supply (5V or 12V depending on LED strip)

# 🏗️ Circuit Diagram

LM393 Sound Sensor

VCC → 5V (Arduino)

GND → GND (Arduino)

AO (Analog Output) → A0 (Arduino)

LED Strip

VCC → External Power (5V/12V)

GND → GND (Arduino & Power Supply common ground)

Data (for WS2812B) → Arduino Pin (e.g., D6)

# 🔧 Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the FastLED library installed if using WS2812B LEDs. Install it via Arduino Library Manager or:


# 3️⃣ Adjust Sensitivity

Modify the potentiometer on the LM393 module for better sensitivity.

Adjust the map() function range in the code to fine-tune LED responsiveness.



# 💡 Customization

Change LED colors dynamically

Add effects (fading, pulsing, etc.)

Use multiple sensors for stereo visualization
